# VAT-Spy color themes

Visual color themes to spruce up VAT-Spy.

## Installation

Replace the contents of `%AppData%\VAT-Spy\VATSpyConfig.xml` (or just the color/font sections of it) with the contents of the `.xml` file with your desired theme. Note that themes make use of fonts, defined in the `.xml` files. If the font used is not available on your system, it obviously won't look the same.

## Themes

##### Dark Blue - `dark-blue.xml`
